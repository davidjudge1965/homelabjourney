# Home Lab Journey
This repo holds my notes, instructions and thoughts around my journey into home labbing.

I've been homelabbing for many years now, but as I embark on new explorations I wanted to document the journey.

I have implemented or plan to implement k8s (in the form of [k3s](https://k3s.io)), implement some monitoring (probably Prometheus and Grafana), and create some AI agents (probably using [n8n](https://n8n.io/)). Some app may be deployed to k3s along the way.

Underlying this effort are:
- One Proxmox VE server (AMD Ryxen 5 5600G, 64GiB RAM, 5GiB Storage)
- Docker VM (for earlier experiments)
- Ansible server VM
- My deskside computer (Ryzen 5 5600, 48GiB) can run VMs too:
    - Hyper-V 
    - VMware Workstation Pro


## A bit about me
I've been working in IT for all my professional life and for some time before that as a student.

Since the early 1980's, I have been employed as:
- Support engineer / Escalations Manager
- IT Manager
- Consultant (in Business Rules)
- Presales in AIOps, Observability, NetOps, Automation, etc.
